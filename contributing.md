* Write descriptions in sentence case (not Title Case).
* The link should be the name of the package or project.
* Links and categories should be sorted alphabetically.
* Add one link per pull-request.
* Keep descriptions concise, clear and simple, and end them with a period/stop.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* New categories, or improvements to the existing ones are also welcome.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
